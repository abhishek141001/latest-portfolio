      excerpt: "A comprehensive guide to building scalable and performant web applications using Next.js 14.",
      content: `Hi, I'm Abhishek Raj, a software developer passionate about creating modern web applications. In this article, I'll share my experience and insights on building scalable applications with Next.js 14.

1. Server Components and Client Components:
Next.js 14 introduces a powerful paradigm with Server and Client Components. Understanding when to use each is crucial for optimal performance. Server Components reduce the JavaScript bundle size and improve initial page load, while Client Components enable interactive features.

2. App Router and File-based Routing:
The new App Router in Next.js provides a more intuitive way to organize your application. With file-based routing, you can create nested layouts, loading states, and error boundaries with ease. This structure makes it easier to maintain and scale your application.

3. Data Fetching and Caching:
Next.js offers multiple ways to fetch data, from Server Components to Route Handlers. The built-in caching mechanisms help optimize performance and reduce server load. Understanding these patterns is essential for building efficient applications.

4. Deployment and Optimization:
With features like Image Optimization, Font Optimization, and automatic code splitting, Next.js makes it easier to create performant applications. The framework also provides excellent deployment options through Vercel or other platforms.`,

      title: "Real Feedback on AI Code Editors: Using Cursor, Copilot, Rooh Code and Codeium in Production",
      excerpt: "Tried and tested in real business projects — here's what it's like using Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Rooh Code, and Codeium as a software developer.",
      content: `If you're a developer wondering whether AI code editors like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Rooh Code or Codeium can actually help you in real-world projects, this article is for you. I've used these tools while working on production-level business applications and I'm sharing my honest experience.
    
    This is not a general overview — it's feedback based on using these tools in live environments where stability and quality matter.
    
    1. Do AI Code Editors Really Save Time?
    
    Yes, in many situations they do. These tools are helpful when:
    - Writing repetitive or boilerplate code  
    - Creating initial components and setup files  
    - Generating basic unit tests  
    - Writing utility functions quickly  
    
    For small to medium-sized tasks, especially when speed is important, they can save a good amount of development time.
    
    2. But Things Get Complicated in Real Projects
    
    In business-critical systems or large codebases, using AI tools comes with challenges:
    - They don't always understand your unique business logic  
    - Generated code often needs review and manual changes  
    - Long-term maintainability can suffer if used carelessly  
    - They can speed up the start, but not the end-to-end workflow  
    
    While AI can help generate ideas or code quickly, you still need deep knowledge of your system to make it work reliably.
    
    3. What's the Trade-Off?
    
    There's a clear trade-off between productivity and quality:
    - Time saved writing code  
    - Time spent reviewing or correcting what AI suggested  
    - Possible drop in architecture or consistency if you're not careful  
    - More effort needed to keep code clean and future-proof  
    
    If you're not reviewing every line properly, these tools can introduce technical debt instead of saving time.
    
    4. Asking Other Developers: What's Been Your Experience?
    
    If you're also using AI tools in production, I'd love to hear from you. Some useful questions to reflect on:
    - Are they really making your work faster or better?  
    - Have you found unexpected benefits or problems?  
    - Are you using them in all projects or only for specific tasks?  
    - Have they changed how you think about writing software?  
    
    Your feedback can help others make better decisions about which tools to try and how to use them effectively.
    
    5. Final Thoughts on Using AI Editors
    
    These tools are improving rapidly, and they definitely have value. But they work best when paired with developer experience, not as a replacement for it.
    
    The goal is to use them in a smart way:
    Get help with routine tasks  
    - Maintain your own code quality standards  
    - Always review and understand the output  
    - Use them as assistants, not automatic solutions  
    
    AI code editors are powerful, but thoughtful usage is key. When used well, they can boost productivity without lowering quality.
    
    Have you tried any of these tools in real-world development? Let me know how they performed in your projects. It's time we move beyond demos and share practical insights.`,

      title: "The Real Struggles of Building a Product from Scratch",
      excerpt: "From the outside, building a product looks simple. But in reality, it's messy. This is the story of what it's really like to build from scratch.",
      content: `From the outside, building a product looks simple.
You imagine a straight path:
Idea → Plan → Build → Launch.

But in reality, it's messy:
Confusion → Testing → Failing → Learning → Adjusting → Progress.

This is the story of what it's really like.

## The Exciting but Unclear Beginning

When we started, we had one big goal:

"Move people from the old way of working to a new, automated system."

It sounded straightforward.
But there was a hidden challenge — no one could clearly describe the exact problem we were solving.

People close to the work described the symptoms — things like delays, manual errors, and lack of tracking — but not the root cause.
It was like being told "the house is leaking" without knowing which pipe is broken.

## No Map, Only a Compass

We didn't have documentation.
We didn't have process flows.
We didn't even have structured data to work with.

Everything existed in people's heads, and if you asked five different people, you'd get five different answers.

The founder's vision gave us direction — like a compass pointing north — but there was no map to navigate the journey.

## Failing Fast… and Often

We were excited to build.
We didn't wait for a perfect plan.
We made quick assumptions, designed a basic structure, and implemented our first version in record time.

It didn't work.
We tried again with a slightly different approach.
It failed again.
And again.

From the outside, it might have looked like we were just "getting it wrong."
But inside, we were learning fast.

Every failed attempt revealed new truths:

- The steps we thought were critical weren't as important.
- Some bottlenecks existed in places we never considered.
- Certain manual tasks couldn't be automated without first changing how people worked.

## Spotting Patterns Through Data and Operations

The real breakthrough came when we moved closer to the operations team.
We stopped guessing.
We started observing.

We watched how the work actually flowed — not how it was described in meetings.
We reviewed every interaction.
We dug into whatever data we could get our hands on.

Slowly, patterns started to appear.

- The same mistakes happened again and again at certain steps.
- Certain tasks always caused delays no matter who handled them.
- Some data fields were entered inconsistently, breaking automation later in the process.

These patterns became the foundation for the right solution.

## Shaping the Real Product

Once we understood these patterns, everything changed.
We redesigned the product flow to match the reality of operations, not our early assumptions.
We built automation that handled repetitive, high-error tasks first.
We created a basic knowledge base to keep everyone aligned.

The more we learned, the more the product aligned with real business needs.

## Lessons from the Journey

Looking back, here's what building from scratch taught me:

**Clarity isn't instant — you have to earn it.**
Understanding comes from deep observation, not from the first meeting.

**A vision is a compass, not a map.**
The founder or leader can tell you where they want to go, but you still have to figure out how to get there.

**Fail fast, fail often, but learn every time.**
Early failures are not waste; they are speed bumps that show you the right road.

**Patterns are the key to progress.**
If a problem keeps repeating, it's pointing at something worth fixing.

**The real work is before the code.**
Writing code is easy once you truly understand the problem.

## Final Thought

Building from scratch isn't just about launching fast — it's about learning fast.
The more time you spend understanding the problem, the less time you waste building the wrong solution.

And if you fail? Fail fast, fail forward, and let each failure guide your next move.`,
